          <p><q> Go only when you’re ready… [but] don’t wait until you’re 100% ready, because you will probably never be 100% ready.”</q>

          <p>First customer contact can mean very different things for different businesses. It could be a product launch or it could be your first meeting with a large company. No matter what it looks like for your business, it’s almost always a critical moment. This is when you start to turn unknown unknowns, things you didn't know you needed to know, into known unknowns, things you know will drive your business forward. This is where you start to learn how much you need to do to get your business ready for prime time.</p>

          <p>First customer contact is almost always a powerful learning experience, but it's different with Business to Business (B2B) and Business to Consumer (B2C) startups.</p>
          <h2>First Contact: Other Businesses</h2>

          <p>Often, the most time consuming aspect of getting that first meeting with another business is establishing the relationships which get you in the door.  A common approach is to use existing networks to get that connection. What that's not enough, don’t be afraid to just introduce yourself. (For more tips on that, reference our <a href="http://learn.thesource.co/lessons/power-distance">power distance lesson</a>.)</p>
          <p>The most essential element of making a great first impression is framing the relationship as being fundamentally reciprocal. This has worked for Femi Akinde, founder of Slim Trader, one of Nigeria's fastest-growing tech companies, and for Edward, who started a relationship with Tigo, a major Ghnaaian telco to develop Nandimobile 5 years ago. Sure, the airline and telecom companies they were meeting with were many times larger than they were, but that didn’t change the fact that they had something valuable to offer.</p>
          <p>For those two entrepreneurs, it came down to being confident and upfront when discussing the shortcomings of these large companies and what they could do to help. The transparency of the interactions made it easy for both sides to see the benefits and say yes.</p>
          <h2>Meeting Your Consumers</h2>
          <p><q>Software entrepreneurs spend too much time behind PCs and laptops. Truthfully, most of the major milestones we had were not because of our superior engineering, but because of the people we met and the impact we made... People should get out there... meet people. The answer to your problem might be in someone else’s head, and one phone call could change your business.</q>
          - Edward Amartey-Tagoe, Founder of Nandimobile, MEST Incubator </p>

          <p>Your first interaction with the public as your potential consumers can come through a business you’ve partnered with or through your own launch or a product or service. Either way, doing this right requires using an open mind to understand those consumers. This often means understanding just how wrong your initial assumptions were, so be prepared for change your perspective on a lot of things.</p>
          <p>Arthur Zang is the creator of Cardiopad, a device that allows rural doctors to run specialised heart tests with the help of heart specialists sitting hundreds of miles away. Early customer contact surprised him.  It taught him that his medical device had two distinct customers/users, each with their own needs. His solution was to develop different software for each, something more technical for the doctors and simpler for the nurses. He also found that a closed ecosystem for his software made things simpler and more straightforward by not asking the consumer to install anything.</p>
          <p>Edward went out with questionnaires, talking to his potential customers and listening carefully to what they had to say. The product was designed directly for the people who would use it, so when they encountered it for the first time, it would predict their needs. As a result, he was able to grow Nandimobile into a national player with major corporate customers like Astral Integral. The company now has the size and the reliable growth necessary for him to transfer out of active management and to invest his time in new endeavors.</p>
