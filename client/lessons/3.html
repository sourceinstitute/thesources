        <p>Matt is a former Deloitte consultant who started a business called Standard Microgrid to provide scalable power to rural Africa. They have the potential to leapfrog the Western version of electrification, much in the way mobile phones leapfrogged landlines there. They want to move straight to smart grids which generate power where it’s used.</p>

        <p>They found they were spending around 9% of their time applying for grants and working with foundations to raise money - they raised $250,000 USD in 9 months from 3 grants.</p>
        <p>We asked Matt to show us his system.</p>

    <h2>Transcripts</h2>
<h2> You’ve raised a quarter million dollars from three grants in 9 months. How do you do it?</h2>
<p>There are two big parts to getting grants. The first is to find them. Here you’ve got to look firstly to your networks, you might know people who sit on foundations boards or who have an interest in the space. Those are typically your most powerful connections. You want that warm introduction for your idea or platform because it comes with their vote of confidence.</p>
<p>The other way is you start googling, looking for grants. Also, try searching for the terms “soft loans” and “development capital”. Then, look at what’s in your space. For us it’s energy, but it could be something more specific like renewables or employing women. We try to make sure our manager is a woman, for example, so we have more options. You have to think about all the different angles your business has. This is speaking to the fact that you’re operating in an impact space. “Is it good for the environment, is it helping poor people, is it making people safe, is it improving education, is it helping food security?” Those typically align to sustainable development goals. So, you can also spin your business a bit to fit it into one or several of those boxes. Then you can look at what kind of grants are in that space. I start organizing a list with information like “who is the entity providing grant funding, what program is it?” adding a link to their site.</p>
<p>We had to make this deliver enough return to attract private capital. It had to offer value to the end user and appropriate levels of return to the investors.</p>

<p>We worked hard to use tech to make a scalable system. We said, where can tech help us scale our ability to manage many sites, to access the viability of deployment in a village, and to work with a community? The business process is designed to work with the community in managing the project, which reduces operating costs. We were trying to solve a problem. If you need to maintain a system in a remote area you need to maintain a skilled individual in that area. So let’s make a system that’s really low on maintenance.</p>



<h2>At the beginning, what did you mean by funding?</h2>
<p>We were thinking about the capital needed to deploy standard microgrids. But we didn’t even know how much one costs, so we knew we couldn’t ask for funding at that stage. In response, we built financial models which told us how much a system would cost and what returns it could generate. That showed us we had a commercial proposition. But to prove it we would look for grant funding. It was because we had existing relationships with grant funders, particularly US NGOs we had deployed systems for, very specific foundations like Powered by Light and The Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation which are only trying to get power into African villages.  They were early supporters who indicated they would be willing to support testing the idea in the field.</p>
<p>It wasn’t “please give us money” because they wanted to make their impact sustainable. They were saying “we’re quite interested in becoming a soft loan funder instead of a grant funder.” A soft loan funder provides a long payment period with very low interest rates. But you return the capital. We said “you can totally achieve your impact and funding objectives if we get this right. But, will you help us prove we can do it?” They were on board.</p>
<p>We knew that trying to find funding at that point was going to be fruitless. We had a good idea but not enough to show for it. We needed to put some of our own time and money into the development to take it to the point where we had something concrete.</p>
<h2>So you went to them with an idea but not clear numbers? You asked what they were up to and established the parameters of what you’d need to succeed. </h2>
<p>We had, in principle, funding to do two pilots, to test the deployed system as it was designed in the field. Then we got funding for a third pilot from a totally different source. Brian met a community in Tanzania who said they wanted power and he agreed to work on it. So he applied to the US Africa Development Fund and they agreed. Just like that, we had funding for the third pilot.</p>
<h2> What other options did you consider and why were grants your ultimate choice?</h2>
<p>We understood we were building a business with an impact, social, environmental, socioeconomic, and that there’s a lot of grant money looking for those impacts. Therefore, we knew we had potential. We wanted it to be commercially fundable, but we couldn’t start there because investors didn’t have that kind of risk appetite. You can do that once you’ve proven a business model. The grant funding was crucial for those first steps to get to that stage.</p>
<h2> How do you compare grant funding to debt and equity?</h2>
<p>Grant funding comes in a few different forms. Typically your return is in the form of impact instead of repayment and return (though they can mix those up). We wouldn’t qualify for debt because we didn’t have a balance or credit history. We were doing things in a way which didn’t match what banks were looking for. Banks would just see risk everywhere. From an equity point of view, we had early overtures from big energy companies, but felt we wanted to control our idea and ensure it grew into what we wanted. That was a 100 year company, not one which would get swallowed up by a big energy firm. We felt if we went the equity route early we’d be starting to sacrifice those goals and objectives.</p>
<p>Because grant funding was an option, we didn’t have to make that tough decision. Now we’re going to the next phase of looking for proof of scale funding, which is a different pocket of funding. Proof of concept is when you’ve done a lot of work but it’s not in the field. We were doing it all ourselves. But now we were deploying to in-field testing. We know the funding cycle is quite long, so you can’t start looking for funding when you need it, you have to think about it sooner. We built in a 6 month lead time and applied for a whole other round of proof of scale funders by which time we had our story, could describe our product very well, could describe how it worked, and had market survey data from our actual customers. Our story was a lot stronger. Now, we’re waiting to hear back from them.</p>
<h2> How does this change your relationship with the energy investors you originally spoke to, IE your progress with grant money?</h2>
<p>I think initially they felt they had something we wanted (their money), but the most powerful thing we said was “no”. That took them aback and made them even more interested. It was a weird dynamic. The power dynamic changed a lot with that answer. Then, the more of a track record we developed the more powerful we became. It was always really important that an equity partner share our vision and could really contribute to our team by opening doors, providing expertise, etc.</p>

<h2> Can you explain how you’re using grant money for leveraging VCs and the thinking around that?</h2>

<p>When we looked at the grant money, we realized by using it to do a proof of concept and proof of scale, we’re now proving the business, establishing a track record, and adding value. That means we can defer the need to take equity to much later in our growth plan.</p>

<h2> Why is that good?</h2>

<p>We feel if we take on equity very early it will be very expensive, we’ll have to give away a big chunk of the business on unfavorable terms. Whereas, if we do it later they come on closer to our terms. We’ll still have to meet in the middle but we’ll be in a better position. We aren’t begging because we don’t necessarily need it.</p>

<p>That’s the key to unlock the next stage of funding, we’ve said in the applications that we’re busy doing the pilots so we’ve said we’d like them to ask how the pilots are going. We can handle variations on the basic success of the pilots, but ultimately our biggest concern is getting them to work on a fundamental level.</p>


<h2> How big is your grant listing spreadsheet?</h2>

<p>This one has 23 entries, the mildly relevant ones.</p>

<h2> How long did it take you to create this?</h2>

<p>It’s ongoing but the bulk of this was over the course of two weeks.</p>

<p>Then the other important thing is to tell your friends, family, colleagues, etc. Because everyone is trawling the internet all the time. They’re getting sent stuff all the time, particularly if they’re working in that same space.</p>

<h2> How many grants did you apply for?</h2>

<p>20 or more, for the three we got. They had different angles and such but it was a lot of work to get those three.</p>

<p>Typically, they’re looking for very similar things. They all want to understand your business. Some have specific formats while others just want you to send them a business plan. Some just want a slide deck. If they like what they see you’ll get a call with more specific questions. A really important thing to do is write a great business plan. It needs to be high level and detailed but it also can’t capture every tiny detail. Typically you have ten pages to say what it is and what it does. Acumen is a brilliant format because it covers so many aspects because they’re looking for broader things than a typical business plan. They’re looking for the social impact of your business and give you some pointers there. They ask about the sustainability, the financials, the product, how the existing problem is being solved? I found that a really helpful format. When I’m applying for a grant I copy elements of that plan into the grant or, once you’ve filled in the details you submit that business plan. It went through about 20 versions. It pays to be organized.</p>

<p>One we put a lot of focus on was the Development Innovation Ventures Fund run by USAID. This is one I found through Google and they had a really good process of defining what they were looking for and had aligned their funding to their stage of business. That’s a trend I’m noticing is becoming more popular. So, if you need funding for proof of concept they might give around $100K. The interesting thing about development innovation labs is that they’re looking for data driven businesses. The nature of our business is that we run everything through a mobile app which tracks all of our measures. So, we were quite a good fit for this as they were looking for data driven business models.</p>

<h2>How did you find that out?</h2>

<p>Their website had a lot of detail on what they’re looking for. It had information on things they’ve funded in the past. They have a fact sheet about everything you could want to know. It helps to spend time reading all of the about information and especially the FAQs. They give you a lot of guidance on what they do and don’t do, so it’s important to read and understand all of that. Be honest with yourself as to whether or not you fit that. Otherwise you’re wasting your time and their time. Be a good filter for yourself and be honest.</p>

<p>Figure out whether you don’t apply or whether it’s worth shifting your business to fit some of those parameters.</p>

<p> What were some of the decisions you faced in fitting those parameters?</p>

<p>When we were planning our growth we aligned it to the way the USAID grant was structured. We really wanted their stage 2 funding so that’s what we targeted. We made our application fit what they were looking for as best as possible.</p>

<h2> How did you do that?</h2>

<p>A really helpful planning tool, and I’m a finance guy by background, has been having a funding model. We’ve got a pretty robust model we can use to test different scenarios, what they’d look like and how much money we’d need. So we figured out we’ll need 1.5 million in capital to deploy 20 units and therefore looked at what kind of grants were available for that stage. So so figure out how much money is available, you look at your plan, you ask if you can go bigger or smaller, etc.</p>

<p> so this spreadsheet lets you try different scenarios and test how much money you’ll need to do different things. How long did it take to create this model and how fast does it make you in responding?</p>

<p>It took 4-5 working days to create and then refining is as we go. But then, it’s really quick to figure things out. I’ve built it to create operating data in addition to financial data. Often grant funders are looking for impact projections and how you measure that. We worked out that our pace of growth determined how much capital we needed. We had to balance our growth ambitions against our ability to raise funding at different times.</p>

<p>The fact that I can do this is incredibly helpful. If you know someone with these skills to build one for you it would be unbelievably helpful. Yours doesn’t have to be totally automated, but it’s not rocket science, it’s applying the logic of your system. So it allows you to get a fast answer as to whether or not the funding is enough, what will its impacts be, what change do we need to make in response to those funding numbers, etc.</p>

<h2> I can see how this speeds up your ability to evaluate grants, your promises, and your pitches. What else allows you to speed up that process?</h2>

<p>The list of potentials I mentioned. Once you generate that list you discover things like that there’s an implied minimum size. They’re geared to give five or twenty million dollar grants, but I wouldn’t know what to do with that amount so I’m not going to get it. Also important is the type of grant, whether it’s debt, equity, or venture capital. Depending on that what I did here was collect my thinking on each thing, discussed it, and prioritized it. So we’ve put our top three funds and put the most effort into those. That was based on the nature of the funding, the amounts, as well as qualitative considerations. For example, having USAID as a partner opens a lot of doors for us. What we have is what suits us now. The next fundraising chunk we need is 10 million, so now we’re in the VC ballgame. We’re actually hoping to raise some debt at that point. So I can go back to that list and reprioritize.</p>

<h2> I assume then you’ll also add to that list.</h2>

<p>Yeah. And as we go along we meet people who express interest, we also build it as we go.</p>

<h2>You mentioned copy-pasting...</h2>

<p>From that point of view, what I’ll do is show you the final version of our business plan. What’s really important here is that this captures the essence of what everyone is looking for in one way or another. Some of our detail and graphs helps us to explain our business model to the Westerners who are reading our business plan. Put that person in the shoes of your customer so they understand its value. If they’re comparing it to their own experience they might not understand it.</p>

<p> I normally think about a business plan as a thing to predict the future, but here you’re writing something you know in order to explain it to people who don’t know about your business.</p>

<p>You’ve got to get them the context but not too much so as to bore them. It says “we’ve been there, what we’ve built is based on our experiences in the field”.</p>

<p>The other thing you can do to add validity to your business plan is to use research reports. In the impact space people spend huge amounts of money just understanding the problems. It’s really useful to understand things like how many people don’t have power in sub-saharan Africa. I’m using this IFC report to validate my data.</p>
